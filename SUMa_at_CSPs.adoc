### Support

 The SUSE Manager is supported directly by the worldwide SUSE Global Technical Support team or your assigned Premium Support Engineer.
 This is true whether the SUMA subscription is purchased directly from SUSE or the Azure Marketplace.

  Please ensure your SUMA product is registered to your SUSE Customer Center ( SCC ) organization ( SCC.SUSE.COM). Once logged in to the SCC, use the "Support" option under "My Tools" on the homepage to open a support case with SUSE. If you have any questions, a FAQ and a User Guide are available under the "Help" link on the landing page.
But simpler would be use the SUMa PAYG version if possible.
