# SUMAatCSPs

A quick decision and overview guide for SUMa at CSPs

Usage:
 Text its written in asciidoc and can simply used as input for DAPS https://opensuse.github.io/daps/
 DAPS can output in different formats e.g pdf


To build a PDF or HTML version of the example document, run:
 daps -d ./DC-daps pdf
or
 daps -d ./DC-daps html

DAPS needs the adoc file in the directory adoc, so we use a link from main directory to the adoc directory for simpler reading and usage

DAPS will create the output file in the build directory ./build/daps
